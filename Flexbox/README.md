## FlexBox Tutorial

This folder contains three exercises to help you practice using flexbox. **main.css** has basic styling for the page and it doesn't need to be touched.**flexSolution.css** contains the solution code. 

In order to complete the exercises, the correct flex properties need to be added to flex.css. 

## Motivation

This repo is a part of a mini css workshop that I am giving. We will be discussing flex properties and then implementing them during our three exercises. 

...Exercise 1: an environment to test the different flex properties.   
...Exercise 2: will be to make a simple navigation bar.   
...Exercise 3: make a photo gallery.  
 
## Installation

Clone the repo and open index.html in your browser. Add flex properties to flex.css to format the html. If you want to see the solution code, change the css stylesheet in index.html from flex.css to flexSoluton.css.
