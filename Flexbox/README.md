## FlexBox Tutorial

This folder contains three exercises to help you practice using flexbox. main.css has basic styling for the page and it doesn't need to be touched. In order to complete the exercises, the correct flex properties need to be added to flex.css. flexSolution.css contains the solution code. 

## Motivation

This repo is a part of a mini css workshop that I am giving. We will be discussing flex properties and then implementing them during our three exercises. The first exercise is just an environment to test the different flex properties. The second exercise will be to make a simple navigation bar and the third exercise is to make a photo gallery.

## Installation

Clone the repo and open index.html in your browser. Add flex properties to flex.css to format the html. If you want to see the solution code, change the css stylesheet in index.html from flex.css to flexSoluton.css.
